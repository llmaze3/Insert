# Insertion Sort Algorithm 
A program to display the insertion sort algorithm

# What I learned 
- Initialization: Loop invariant holds before the first loop interation
- Maintenance: The loop invariant is maintained after each iteration: arrat[1..j] is in sorted order and j is incremented.
- Termination: The for loop terminateds when j>array.length. 
- Time Complexity: O(n^2)
